# learn how to use MATLAB
0. All tutorials are sourced from [MATLAB_learning_web](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/)
1. prompt = 提示符
2. interactive = 交互式的
3. alternative = 可选的/供替代的选择
4. calculation = 计算结果
5. assignment operator = 赋值操作符(means that the expression on the right of the equals sign is assigned to the variable on the left)
6. evaluate = 求...的值
7. semicolon = *;*
8. suppress = 抑制->不显示(结果)
9. just enter the variable name in the command , MATLAB will return it's current value.
10. MATLAB will **not** automatically refresh varibale's value who is determined by other variables when they are changed.
11. contain = include
12. letter = 字母
13. underscore = *_*
13. MATLAB just support varibale names which start with a letter and contain only letters , numbers and underscores;
14. sensitive = 敏感的
15. case sensitive = 大小写敏感
16. MATLAB variables are case sensitive.
17. a suggested correction = 一个修正建议
18. demonstrate = 证明/展示
19. *save < filename > [specified varible name]* command is used to save current variables in the workspace to a *.mat* file.
20. *clear* command is used to clear all the current variables.
21. specified = 指定的
22. exhibit = 展示
23. *load < filename > [specified varible name]* command is used to load variables from a *.mat* file.
    * *Note*: The loaded data is exhibited as a list,if you want to show all of them , just input the list's name.
24. *clc* command is used to clear the command window.
25. constant = 常量/常数
26. represent = 代表/表示
27. built-in = 内置的
28. decimal = 小数位
29. internally = 内部地
30. precision = 精度
31. *pi* = built-in constant $\pi$
32. *sin* = built-in function sin trangle function
33. square root = 开方(求根)
34. *sqrt* = built-in function for square root
35. imaginary = 虚构的-> imaginary number = 虚数
36. suffix = 前缀
37. postfix = 后缀
38. cent = 美分

38. *format < varible type >* command preprocess the following variable's type(such as long short shorte longe (-e postfix means it is a float type) hex etc).  
here is the type's sheet  
| general type            | parameter |
|:------------------------|----------:|
| short int(default type) |     short |
| long int                |      long |
| float(5_digits)         |    shorte |
| long float(15_digits)   |     longe |


| special type                                                                                      | parameter |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------:|
| Engineering format that has at least 5 digits and a power that is a multiple of three             |  shorteng |
| Engineering format that has exactly 16 significant digits and a power that is a multiple of three |   longeng |
| hexadecimal format                                                                                |       hex |
| show sign marks(+,-,< blank >[blank means zero])                                                  |         + |
| Fixed format for dollars and cents                                                                |      bank |
| ratio of small integers                                                                           |       rat |
| show answer more readable                                                                         |     loose |
| show answer more closed                                                                           |   compact |
* *Note1*: rat parameter can be used to show the fraction.
* *Note2*: each format command only have one parameter.
